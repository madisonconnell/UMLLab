	One major difference between my code and the Umple code is that my code has my methods,
while my Umple does not because it kept crashing everytime I would add a method, however correct 
it was. Another major difference that took some getting used to was that Umple defaulted the primitive
type to String and therefore did not list the word "String" for an object of that type. The only other
major difference is the grouping of the classes; I put my classes in seperate places in eclipse, while
Umple groups them all in the same place. The other thing about classes is that Umple does not explictly
state if it is a private or public class, while I did in my code. Overall, the code still does the same
thing, however.
	I think Umple is most useful for helping me visualize my class relations. It occasionally confuses
me if one thing is the parent or the child class, and physically drawing it out helps me distinguish the
two. It is also good for me to see the pluses or minuses to simply remember what is public or private.
Overall, I would not use it to generate code, but as a visual tool to get the concept of inheritance in
relation to individual projects.
